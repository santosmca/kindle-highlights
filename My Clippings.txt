Your request affects him, but it does not control him. Likewise, casting spells and saying prayers affects the targets of those spells and prayers, but they cannot control them. Successful magic doesn’t necessarily bring you what you asked for (much less what you want), but it moves the odds in your favor. And whatever it does, it does within the boundaries of nature.

Perhaps your reaction is out of proportion to the situation, or perhaps it’s not helpful. Deal with that later. In the moment, accept that your feelings are real and valid. Do no harm—to others or to yourself—but allow yourself to feel what you feel.
